# Encode and Decode Strings

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

```
Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
Explanation:
One possible encode method is: "4#lint4#code4#love3#you"
```
